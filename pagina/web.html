            <h1>Introduction to Biophysics</h1>
            <p>Biophysics is an interdisciplinary science that applies approaches and methods traditionally used in physics to study biological phenomena. Biophysics covers all scales of biological organization, from molecular to organismic and populations. Biophysical research shares significant overlap with biochemistry, molecular biology, physical chemistry, physiology, nanotechnology, bioengineering, computational biology, biomechanics, developmental biology and systems biology.
                </p>
            <p>The term biophysics was originally introduced by Karl Pearson in 1892.</p>
            <p>Molecular biophysics typically addresses biological questions similar to those in biochemistry and molecular biology, seeking to find the physical underpinnings of biomolecular phenomena. Scientists in this field conduct research concerned with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell, including the interactions between DNA, RNA and protein biosynthesis, as well as how these interactions are regulated. A great variety of techniques are used to answer these questions.</p>
            <p>In addition to traditional (i.e. molecular and cellular) biophysical topics like structural biology or enzyme kinetics, modern biophysics encompasses an extraordinarily broad range of research, from bioelectronics to quantum biology involving both experimental and theoretical tools. It is becoming increasingly common for biophysicists to apply the models and experimental techniques derived from physics, as well as mathematics and statistics, to larger systems such as tissues, organs, populations and ecosystems. Biophysical models are used extensively in the study of electrical conduction in single neurons, as well as neural circuit analysis in both tissue and whole brain.</p>

                    <h3>Knots and Links</h3>
                <p>A knot is an smooth embedding of the circle (\(S^1\)) into three-dimensional Euclidean space (\(\mathbb{R}^3\)), or the 3-sphere (\(S^3\)), since the 3-sphere is compact. Two knots are defined to be equivalent if there is an ambient isotopy between them.</p>
                
                \[
                f: S^1 \hookrightarrow S^3 \quad \text{(or \( \mathbb{R}^3 \))},
                \]

                <p>where \( f \) is a continuous and differentiable function, and the symbol \( \hookrightarrow \) denotes an embedding.
                </p>

                <p>Two knots \( f, g: S^1 \hookrightarrow S^3 \) are equivalent if there exists an ambient isotopy \( H: S^3 \times [0,1] \to S^3 \) such that: </p>

                \[
                H(x, 0) = x \quad \text{and} \quad H(f(S^1), 1) = g(S^1),
                \]

                <p>i.e., \( H \) deforms the ambient space \( S^3 \) continuously, transforming the knot \( f(S^1) \) into the knot \( g(S^1) \) without breaking or cutting.
                </p>

                <p>We will not go into much more detail, as these topics are explored further in an introductory course on Algebraic Topology.
                </p>
                <p>In mathematical knot theory, a <strong>link</strong> is a collection of disjoint knots, i.e., a collection of embeddings \( f_i: S^1 \hookrightarrow S^3 \) for \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, n \), such that the images \( f_i(S^1) \) do not intersect for \( i \neq j \). These components may, however, be <strong>linked</strong> or <strong>knotted</strong> together. A <strong>knot</strong> is a special case of a link consisting of a single component. Links and knots are studied in a branch of mathematics called knot theory.
                    </p>
                    <p>Implicit in this definition is the existence of a trivial reference link, commonly called the <strong>unlink</strong>, which consists of a collection of unknots that are pairwise unlinked. However, the term "link" is also sometimes used in contexts where there is no defined notion of a trivial link.
                    
                    For example, a co-dimension 2 link in 3-dimensional space is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^3 \) (or often the 3-sphere \( S^3 \)) whose connected components are homeomorphic to \( S^1 \). That is, a link \( L \) in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \) or \( S^3 \) is a subset
                    \[
                    L = \bigsqcup_{i=1}^n f_i(S^1),
                    \]
                    where \( \bigsqcup \) denotes a disjoint union, and each \( f_i \) is an embedding of the circle \( S^1 \).
                    
                    <p>The simplest nontrivial example of a link with more than one component is the <strong>Hopf link</strong>, which consists of two circles (or unknots) linked together exactly once. In mathematical terms, the linking number of the two components is \( \operatorname{Link}(f_1(S^1), f_2(S^1)) = 1 \).
                    </p>
                    <p>Another notable example is the <strong>Borromean rings</strong>, a link consisting of three circles. In this case, no two circles are directly linked, but the three components are collectively linked. The Borromean rings form a <strong>Brunnian link</strong>, meaning that removing any one component results in an unlink. Furthermore, the Borromean rings are the simplest example of such a Brunnian link.            
                </p>

                        <h3>Generalizations</h3>
                <p>The notion of a <strong>link</strong> can be generalized in various ways. These generalizations are presented here only as a curiosity, and we will not go into detail.</p>
                
                <h4>General manifolds</h4>
                <p>The term <strong>link</strong> is sometimes used to describe any submanifold of the sphere \( S^n \) that is diffeomorphic to a disjoint union of a finite number of spheres \( S^j \).</p>
                
                <p>In full generality, the word <strong>link</strong> is essentially the same as the word <strong>knot</strong>. Consider a submanifold \( M \) of a manifold \( N \), where \( M \) is trivially embedded in \( N \). A non-trivial embedding of \( M \) in \( N \) (non-trivial in the sense that it is not isotopic to the trivial embedding) can be classified as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If \( M \) is disconnected, the embedding is called a <strong>link</strong> (or said to be linked).</li>
                    <li>If \( M \) is connected, the embedding is called a <strong>knot</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Tangles, string links, and braids</h4>
                <p>In addition to 1-dimensional links (defined as embeddings of circles), it is often useful to consider embedded intervals (or strands), particularly in braid theory. This leads to the notion of a <strong>tangle</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>Most generally, a <strong>tangle</strong> is an embedding 
                \[
                T: X \to \mathbb{R}^2 \times I,
                \]
                where \( X \) is a smooth, compact 1-manifold with boundary \( (X, \partial X) \), and \( I = [0, 1] \). The boundary \( T(\partial X) \) is embedded in 
                \[
                \mathbb{R} \times \{0, 1\} \quad (\{0, 1\} = \partial I).
                \]
                The type of a tangle is determined by the manifold \( X \) together with a fixed embedding of \( \partial X \).</p>

                    Although explored in greater depth in an <a href="#" onclick="navigateToSection('algebraic-topology')">Algebraic Topology</a> course, a cobordism between manifolds 
                    \( M \) and \( N \) is a compact manifold \( W \) whose boundary is the disjoint union of \( M \) and \( N \), expressed as:
                </p>
                <p>
                    \[
                    \partial W = M \sqcup N.
                    \]

                    <h3>Knot diagrams</h3>

                    <p>
                        To study knots, it is common to use their 
                        <strong>projections</strong> onto a plane, which are known as <em>knot diagrams</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A <strong>knot diagram</strong> is a two-dimensional representation of a knot 
                        where over-crossings and under-crossings are explicitly indicated. These crossings 
                        are depicted using breaks in the curve, showing which strand is "on top" and which is "below." 
                        Mathematically, the projection is achieved by mapping the knot in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \) to \( \mathbb{R}^2 \). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Formally, if \( K \) is a knot in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \), its diagram is a projection:
                        \[
                        \pi: K \to \mathbb{R}^2,
                        \]
                        where crossings are marked to distinguish the over-strand and the under-strand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Knot diagrams are crucial because they simplify the study of knots, allowing mathematicians 
                        to work in two dimensions while preserving the essential properties of the knot.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Reidemeister moves</h4>

                    <p>
                        The <strong>Reidemeister moves</strong> are a set of three operations that can be applied 
                        to knot diagrams. They allow transformations of one diagram into another while preserving 
                        the underlying topology of the knot. These moves are fundamental in knot theory because 
                        they describe how different diagrams can represent the same knot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The three Reidemeister moves are:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Type I:</strong> Adding or removing a twist in the strand (see in the figure).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Type II:</strong> Adding or removing two strands that cross over each other (see in the figure).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Type III:</strong> Sliding one strand over a crossing of two other strands (see in the figure).
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Any two diagrams of the same knot can be related to each other through a finite sequence 
                        of these moves. Therefore, the Reidemeister moves provide a foundation for proving 
                        that two knots are equivalent or distinct.

                    <section id="knot-invariants">
                    <h3>Knot invariants</h3>

                    <p>
                        In the mathematical field of <strong>knot theory</strong>, a <em>knot invariant</em> is a property 
                        or quantity associated with a knot that remains unchanged under any deformation of the knot. 
                        These deformations include the application of the <strong>Reidemeister moves</strong>, 
                        which are the fundamental operations used to transform knot diagrams without changing the topology 
                        of the knot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Formally, a knot invariant is a function:
                        \[
                        f: \{\text{knot diagrams}\} \to S,
                        \]
                        where \( S \) is some set (e.g., integers, polynomials, groups), and \( f \) satisfies the property:
                        \[
                        f(D_1) = f(D_2)
                        \]
                        whenever \( D_1 \) and \( D_2 \) represent the same knot in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \). In other words, 
                        the value of the invariant is the same for all diagrams of the same knot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Knot invariants are powerful tools because they help classify knots and distinguish 
                        between knots that might appear similar but are topologically different.
                    </p>
            
                    <h4>Examples of Knot Invariants</h4>
                    <p>
                        Here are some common examples of knot invariants:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Knot Group:</strong> The fundamental group of the knot complement, denoted \( \pi_1(S^3 \setminus K) \), 
                            is a group that encodes information about the knot.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Knot Polynomials:</strong> Polynomial invariants, such as:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Alexander Polynomial:</strong> A polynomial invariant denoted \( \Delta_K(t) \).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Jones Polynomial:</strong> A polynomial invariant denoted \( V_K(t) \).
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Knot Signature:</strong> A numerical invariant derived from the Seifert matrix of the knot.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            
            
                    <h4>Relation to Reidemeister Moves</h4>
                    <p>
                        Since knot invariants are preserved under Reidemeister moves, they serve as 
                        a consistent measure of a knot's properties regardless of its diagram representation. 
                        This is critical for proving that two knots are the same or different.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, if \( f \) is a knot invariant and \( f(D_1) \neq f(D_2) \), 
                        then \( D_1 \) and \( D_2 \) cannot represent the same knot.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Knot complement</h3>

                    <p>
                        In mathematics, the <strong>knot complement</strong> of a tame knot \( K \) (a knot equivalent to a polygonal knot, knots which are not tame are called wild knots) is the space 
                        where the knot is not. Informally, it refers to the remaining space in the ambient 
                        3-dimensional manifold after removing the knot and the space immediately surrounding it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To formalize this, suppose that \( K \) is a knot embedded in a 3-manifold \( M \) (most commonly \( M \) is the 3-sphere, \( S^3 \)). 
                        Let \( N \) be a tubular neighborhood of \( K \), so \( N \) is homeomorphic to a solid torus. 
                        The knot complement is then defined as:
                        \[
                        X_K = M - \text{interior}(N),
                        \]
                        where \( \text{interior}(N) \) represents the interior of the tubular neighborhood \( N \).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The knot complement \( X_K \) is a compact 3-manifold, and its boundary, \( \partial X_K \), 
                        is homeomorphic to a 2-torus (\( T^2 \)). This means that the boundary of the complement is 
                        topologically the same as the boundary of the neighborhood \( N \), which is also a 2-torus.
                    </p>
                
                    <h4>Relation to Knot Invariants</h4>
                    <p>
                        Many <strong>knot invariants</strong> are fundamentally invariants of the knot complement. 
                        For example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The <strong>knot group</strong>, \( \pi_1(X_K) \), is the fundamental group of the knot complement.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the ambient space \( M \) is the 3-sphere (\( S^3 \)), no information is lost by studying the complement 
                        rather than the knot itself. The Gordon–Luecke theorem states:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            If \( K \) and \( K' \) are two knots with homeomorphic complements, then there exists a homeomorphism of 
                            \( S^3 \) that takes \( K \) to \( K' \).
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                        In other words, a knot is uniquely determined by its complement in \( S^3 \).
                    </p>
            
                    <h4>Generalization to Links</h4>
                    <p>
                        The concept of the knot complement generalizes naturally to <strong>link complements</strong>. 
                        For a link (a collection of knots), the complement is defined analogously by removing the 
                        interior of a tubular neighborhood of all the components of the link. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Complements of knots and links are examples of <em>Haken manifolds</em>, which are compact 3-manifolds 
                        that satisfy certain topological properties, making them well-suited for analysis in 3-manifold topology.
